Street Art photo sharing Django app
<!-- everything I thought was going to be hard wasn’t that bad and everything I thought was going to be easy was more difficult. -->

<!-- I learned I much prefer postgresql to mongodb
And I don't really like when django tries doing things for me -->

stART is a platform for sharing photos of murals, graffiti, sculptures, installations, or any other public works of art you can find.
